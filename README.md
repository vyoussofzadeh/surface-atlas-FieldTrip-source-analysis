# Desikanâ€“Killiany-surface-atlas-for FieldTrip-analysis
This page provides an implementation of a surface atlas (e.g., Desikan-Killian) for source analysis in the FieldTrip (FT) toolbox. Here are the steps to genetate a surface atlas (in nii format) that is readable in FT (this process can be generalizable to produce other Freesurfer surface atlases).
