# Desikanâ€“Killiany-surface-atlas-for FieldTrip-analysis
This page provides an example implementation of a source surface atlas (e.g., Desikan-Killiany) parcellation analysis using the FieldTrip toolbox. Steps to genetate a surface atlas (in nii format using the Brainstorm/SPM tool) as well as an example of an atlas parcellation analysis (using color-coded regions) are provided on this repository page. For comments and questions, please reach out to me at vyoussofzadeh@mcw.edu.
